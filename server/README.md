Swagger generated server
Overview

This server was generated by the swagger-codegen project. By using the OpenAPI-Spec from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This is an example of building a node.js server.

This example uses the expressjs framework. To see how to make this your own, look here:

This project leverages the mega-awesome swagger-tools middleware which does most all the work.
